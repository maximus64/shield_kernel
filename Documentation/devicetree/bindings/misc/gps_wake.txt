This driver is implemented to parse the gps_en gpio from device tree
and create a sysfs to control the gpio in gpsd binary. Also it
registers a irq to enable the HW geofencing feature.

SYSFS: This interface is used to toggle gps_en gpio in userspace.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Must be "nvidia,tegra-gps-wake";

Optional Properties:
- gps-en is resource name for gps_en gpio
- gps-host-wake is resource name for host wake irq line

Example:
gps_wake {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra-gps-wake";
	id = <0>;
	gps-en = <&gpio_i2c_1_20 10 0>;
	gps-host-wake = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(Q, 5) 0>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <TEGRA_GPIO(Q, 5) 0x01>;
	status = "disabled";
};
