* ROHM BH1730FVC ambient light sensor

nvs_ drivers use the NVidia Sensor (NVS) framework.
See the nvs.txt documentation for NVS DT capabilities.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "rohm,bh1730fvc"
- reg: i2c address of the device. It should be 0x29.

Optional properties:
- status: set to "ok" or "okay" for normal operation.  Set to anything else
	  to unload the driver without ever communicating with the device.
  Note: The "anything else" above is typically "disabled".
	Since the driver will unload without communicating with the device, the
	device will be left in its POR state.
- vdd-supply: regulator supply for the chip vcc
- vid-supply: regulator supply for the chip dvi
  Note: This is required if the driver is to control the regulator.


Example:
                bh1730fvc@29 {
                        compatible = "rohm,bh1730fvc";
                        reg = <0x29>;
                };
