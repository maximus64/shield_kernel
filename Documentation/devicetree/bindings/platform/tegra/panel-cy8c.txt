CY8C microcontroller driven panel power sequence driver

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "nvidia,cy8c_panel".

Sub-node properties:
- reg : i2c regmap address (app firmware)
- enable-gpio : gpio used to enable uC operations.
	This gpio must remain high for as long as the
	panel is enabled. It may be deasserted after
	the panel is disabled.
- max-xfer-size : minimum of maximum Tegra and maximum
	cy8c I2C transfer chunk sizes

Examples:
	i2c@7000c000 {
		cy8c_panel@09 {
			compatible = "nvidia,cy8c_panel";
			reg = <0x09>;
			enable-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(K, 1) 0>;
			max-xfer-sz = <64>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
		};
	};
};
