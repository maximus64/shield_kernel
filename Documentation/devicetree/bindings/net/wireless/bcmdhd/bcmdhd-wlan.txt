* bcmdhd-wlan devicetree bindings

This file documents the properties used by the bcmdhd-wlan driver.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "android,tegra-bcmdhd-wlan"

Optional properties:
- "wlan-pwr-gpio" is a gpio to power on/off wifi chip
- "wlan-rst-gpio" is a gpio to reset wifi chip
- "interrupts" is a wake on wireless gpio interrupt pin
- "edp-consumer-name" is required to populate wifi edp consumer name

MAC address properties (using the of_get_mac_address() function,
checked in this order):
- 'mac-address' is the "most recent" MAC address (6 octet binary property)
- 'local-mac-address' is the default MAC address (6 octet binary property)
- 'address' is supposed to contain a virtual address of the register set, but
  some DTS files have redefined this property to be the MAC address
  (6 octet binary property)
- 'mac-address-chosen-dtb-node' is the property name of a string property under
  the /chosen dtb node which contains the MAC address string
  "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx"
- 'mac-address-file' is a string property which contains the path of a file
  which contains the MAC address string "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx"

Example:
bcmdhd_wlan {
	compatible = "android,tegra-bcmdhd-wlan";
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <165 0x14>;
	wlan-pwr-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(X, 7) 0>;
	wlan-rst-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(CC, 5) 0>;
	edp-consumer-name = "primary-wifi";
	/* possible methods of specifying MAC address
	 * (in first to last order)
	 */
	mac-address = [00 04 4b fe ed be];
	local-mac-address = [00 04 4b fe ed bf];
	/* the next method requires the /chosen dtb node to have a string
	 * property named "nvidia,wifi-mac" which contains the MAC address
	 * string "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx"
	 */
	mac-address-chosen-dtb-node = "nvidia,wifi-mac";
	/* the next method requires the filesystem file
	 * /mnt/factory/wifi/wifi_mac.txt to contain the MAC address string
	 * "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx"
	 */
	mac-address-file = "/mnt/factory/wifi/wifi_mac.txt";
};

* bcmdhd2-wlan devicetree bindings

This file documents the properties used by the bcmdhd2-wlan driver.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "nvidia,tegra-bcmdhd2-wlan"

Optional properties:
- "wlan-pwr-gpio" is a gpio to power on/off wifi chip
- "wlan-rst-gpio" is a gpio to reset wifi chip
- "interrupts" is a wake on wireless gpio interrupt pin
- "edp-consumer-name" is required to populate wifi edp consumer name

MAC address properties (using the of_get_mac_address() function):
- the bcmdhd2 2nd driver instance is no longer used, so new features
  (such as using the of_get_mac_address() function to get the MAC address)
  have not been ported to bcmdhd2 driver

Example:
bcm4329_wlan2_ {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra-bcmdhd2-wlan";
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <165 0x14>;
	wlan-pwr-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(X, 7) 0>;
	wlan-rst-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(CC, 5) 0>;
	edp-consumer-name = "secondary-wifi";
};
